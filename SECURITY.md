# Security Issues

If you think that you have found a security issue in Strata, please don't use the issue tracker and don't publish it
publicly. Send urgent or sensitive reports directly to [security@studio24.net](mailto:security@studio24.net)

## Resolving Process

If you submit a report, here’s what will happen:

* We’ll acknowledge your report.
* We'll confirm the vulnerability and ask any follow up questions.
* The team will work on a fix.
* Once the issue is resolved, we’ll post a security update along with thanks and credit for the discovery.

Once a patch has been created we will:

* Publish a release for all maintained versions of Strata.
* Update the public [security advisories database](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories).

### Note

* While we are working on a patch, please do not reveal the issue publicly.
* The resolution takes anywhere between a couple of days to a month depending on its complexity.
